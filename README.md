# Calendar Scheduler

## Description

My motivation to create this app was to give a user a scheduling app that would track their work day with their scheduled work items.
I ammended the CSS stylesheet and HTML index to include my workday of 6-6 as well as an hour before and after the work day starts for additional calendar entries.
I wrote the JS script to look at what time it currently was and color code the calendar cells appropriately with past, present, or future.
I built this based off of the user story:
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
